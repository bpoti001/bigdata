In this project I tried to find correlation between two different datasets relased by Medicare 
1)National Claims History 
2)General Payments made by pharmaceutical companies
To do this I took address field as a feature and joined them based on address. 
For each address we calclulated total amount paied by compaines and average of claims submitted.
Finally did a P Test on thie data and plotted a Scatter Graph.
As a result found that even if the total payment value increases there is no hike in the average of submitted claims
